Step 1: Create the Project

Log in to ProjectManager.com
.

Click Projects → New Project.

Enter:

Project Name: Library Management System

Start Date: (choose your planned start date)

Click Create Project.

Step 2: Define Tasks

Switch to Gantt View and add the main tasks:

#	Task Name	Duration (days)	Notes
1	Project Initiation	2	Define scope, stakeholders
2	Requirements Gathering	5	Library features, user roles
3	System Design	6	Database, UI/UX
4	Development	12	Coding catalog, user management, search
5	Testing	5	Functional, integration, UAT
6	Deployment	3	Go live
7	Training & Documentation	3	Train staff, manuals
8	Project Closure	2	Final review, handover
Step 3: Define Dependencies

Link tasks in Gantt View so tasks follow the correct order:

Project Initiation → Requirements Gathering → System Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Training & Documentation → Project Closure


In ProjectManager.com, drag from the end of one task to the start of the next to create dependencies.

Step 4: Assign Resources

Go to Resources → Add Resource.

Example resources:

Resource Name	Type
Project Manager	Work
System Analyst	Work
Developer	Work
Tester	Work
Trainer	Work

Assign resources to tasks:

Task	Assigned Resource
Project Initiation	Project Manager
Requirements Gathering	System Analyst
System Design	System Analyst, Developer
Development	Developer
Testing	Tester
Deployment	Developer
Training & Documentation	Trainer
Project Closure	Project Manager
Step 5: Set Milestones

Add 0-day tasks as milestones:

Milestone	After Task
Requirements Approved	Requirements Gathering
Design Completed	System Design
System Live	Deployment
Project Closed	Project Closure
Step 6: Define Project Calendar

Go to Settings → Calendar.

Set:

Working days: Monday–Friday

Working hours: 9 AM – 5 PM

Holidays: as needed

Apply to project.

Step 7: Baseline the Project

In Gantt → More Options → Set Baseline, save your plan.

This will allow comparison of planned vs actual later.

Step 8: Generate Dashboard

Go to Dashboard → Add Widget.

Add these widgets for the Library Management System project:

Project Overview → % complete, tasks completed, in-progress, upcoming

Cost Overview → planned cost vs actual cost (requires resource cost assigned)

Upcoming Tasks → tasks due soon

Arrange them visually for a clear snapshot.

Step 9: Generate Resource Reports

Go to Reports → Resource Reports.

Generate:

Over-Allocated Resources → highlights team members assigned too much work

Resource Overview → shows each resource, hours assigned, availability

Optionally export reports as PDF or Excel for submission.

Step 10: Monitor and Update

Update % Complete regularly for each task.

Check Dashboard to track progress and costs.

Use Resource Reports to rebalance workload if someone is over-allocated
