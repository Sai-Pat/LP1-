Step 1: Create the Project

Log in to ProjectManager.com
.

Go to Projects → New Project.

Enter:

Project Name: Ticket Management System

Start Date: (choose a planned start date)

Click Create Project.

Step 2: Define Tasks

Switch to Gantt View and add tasks:

#	Task Name	Duration (days)	Notes
1	Project Initiation	2	Define scope, stakeholders
2	Requirements Gathering	5	Ticket types, user roles, workflows
3	System Design	6	Database schema, UI/UX
4	Development	15	Coding ticket creation, tracking, notifications
5	Testing	6	Functional, integration, UAT
6	Deployment	3	Go live in production
7	Training & Documentation	4	User manuals, training sessions
8	Project Closure	2	Review, handover
Step 3: Define Dependencies

Link tasks in Gantt View so each task starts after the previous one:

Project Initiation → Requirements Gathering → System Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Training & Documentation → Project Closure


Drag lines from the end of one task to the start of the next to create dependencies.

Step 4: Assign Resources

Go to Resources → Add Resource.

Example resources:

Resource Name	Type
Project Manager	Work
System Analyst	Work
Developer	Work
Tester	Work
Trainer	Work

Assign resources to tasks:

Task	Assigned Resource
Project Initiation	Project Manager
Requirements Gathering	System Analyst
System Design	System Analyst, Developer
Development	Developer
Testing	Tester
Deployment	Developer
Training & Documentation	Trainer
Project Closure	Project Manager
Step 5: Define Milestones

Add 0-day tasks as milestones:

Milestone	After Task
Requirements Approved	Requirements Gathering
Design Completed	System Design
System Live	Deployment
Project Closed	Project Closure
Step 6: Set Project Calendar

Go to Settings → Calendar.

Set:

Working days: Monday–Friday

Working hours: 9 AM – 5 PM

Holidays: as needed

Apply to the project.

Step 7: Baseline the Project

Go to Gantt → More Options → Set Baseline.

This will allow comparison of planned vs actual later (important for Earned Value and slipping tasks).

Step 8: Assign Costs (Optional but needed for cost reports)

Assign a cost per resource (e.g., hourly rate) in Resources → Edit Resource.

This enables ProjectManager.com to calculate:

Resource Cost Overview

Task Cost Overview

Earned Value Report

Step 9: Generate Cost Reports

Go to Reports → Cost Reports.

Generate the following:

Earned Value Report (EV) → Compare Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV), Actual Cost (AC), Cost Variance (CV), and Schedule Variance (SV)

Resource Cost Overview → Cost per resource vs planned

Task Cost Overview → Cost per task vs planned

Step 10: Generate Progress Reports

Go to Reports → Progress Reports.

Generate:

Critical Tasks → Tasks on the critical path that affect project completion

Milestone Report → Shows completion status of all milestones

Slipping Tasks → Tasks that are behind schedule compared to the baseline

Step 11: Create Dashboard

Go to Dashboard → Add Widget.

Add widgets for:

Cost Overview → shows total project cost and cost status

Task Progress → % complete, upcoming tasks

Critical Tasks → highlights tasks affecting project schedule

Upcoming Milestones → track important dates

Arrange widgets visually for a project snapshot.

Step 12: Review and Monitor

Update % Complete regularly for tasks.

Check Critical Path to prevent delays.

Monitor resource allocation and costs.

Export dashboard and reports as PDF/Excel for submission.
